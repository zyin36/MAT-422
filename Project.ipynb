        "## 3.1 Prioritizing Tasks and Time Management\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many ways to accomplish the prioritizing and completion of tasks by a computer. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLM) allow one to easily communicate with the computer using human language and generate solutions to simple problems without needing to solve them oneself. Good examples of simple problems are finding trustworthy research papers on a given topic or writing an email.\n",
        "\n",
        "LLM's are limited by the size of query (e.g. length of text, size of a picture), the size of the response, the rate of parsing the query and generating the response, and the long term memory of inputs given by the user, and so on. A way of mitigating each of these at once is to have a data structure that the user and the LLM both have access to that contains information about every task completed and to be compeleted by the model. The idea is that this data structure is an organized agenda where the LLM helps with any task the user wants it to (to the best of it's ability).\n",
        "\n",
        "The LLM should be able to break down an assignment into smaller subtasks, and estimate the time needed based on each subtask. The time it takes to complete an assignment depends on the overall difficulty (for the student), the number of items (e.g. the number of math problems) in the assignment, and how much content is required for each item (for example, an 10-page essay has much more content than a single math problem, in general).\n",
        "\n",
        "The priority of a task changes with time, as in the case of any task with a deadline where as the deadline approaches the priority should increase. Every task also needs to reach the highest priority at some point in order to be completed, meaning the rules for priority need to ensure no task is left undone. There are certain tasks that need to completed during a certain period of time, for instance a doctor's appointment or watering a plant, that restict when other tasks can be completed since they are of the highest priority when they are happening. No one can predict everything. For example, an emergency might come up while a student is completing homework before a deadline where they want the model to email the professor asking for an extension. This type of task would supersede all others and be the highest priority.\n",
        "\n",
        "An example algorithm of prioritizing the tasks could be constructed by combining some of these rules and applying them to different task types. The user would need to specify the task type but everything else about it's prioritization is handled by the program. Below is an implementation that prioritizes based on the deadline Deadline-less tasks are added such that the time it would take to complete it and the time it would take to doesn't make it impossible to meet the deadlines in the queue. Thus the the iterated tasks deadline must be greater than the time it would take to complete every\n",

With more functionality and a GUI, a system like this would could be used to make everyday life much easier.  "
